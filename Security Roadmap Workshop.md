# Security Roadmap Workshop

## Introduction & Purpose
The Security Roadmap Workshop helps organisations align strategy, stakeholders, and next steps for improving their Microsoft 365 and cloud security posture.  
It is designed to take findings from earlier engagements (e.g. Sensitivity Labelling, DLP, Secure Score, Essential 8 reviews) and convert them into a practical roadmap.
