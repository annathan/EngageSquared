# Engage Squared - Security Readiness Playbook

This playbook helps E2 consultants and customers build practical security capability beyond data audits.  
It combines Microsoft “Ninja” trainings with E2’s delivery modules so teams can learn, assess, and execute.

---

## How to Use This Playbook

1. **Build common understanding**  
   Run the **Security Foundations** session to align language and principles.

2. **Assess current posture**  
   Run a **Security Architecture Review** to understand where the customer is today.

3. **Plan the uplift**  
   Facilitate a **Security Roadmap Workshop** to set priorities and a Crawl–Walk–Run plan.

4. **Skill up while you deliver**  
   Use the Ninja trainings below to upskill delivery teams and customers in parallel.  
   Then progress into specialised engagements such as **Sensitivity Labelling** and **Basic DLP Advisory**.

---

## How to Apply the Training Content

This playbook is not just a list of links - it is a guide for building capability in a structured way.  
Use it differently depending on the audience:

- **Internal staff readiness**: Start with Ninja modules before your first customer delivery.  
- **Onboarding customers**: Recommend foundational Ninja modules as preparatory learning.  
- **Delivery support**: Use these as enrichment alongside E2 modules like DLP Advisory or Sensitivity Labelling.  
- **Skill enablement**: Institutions and partners benefit by aligning real training pathways to delivery services.

## At a Glance: Training Readiness by Delivery

Use this as a quick reference to determine the minimum skilling needed before delivering each E2 module.  
“Nice to Have” items are optional, but they provide extra confidence and depth.
