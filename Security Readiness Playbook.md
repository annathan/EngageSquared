## How to Apply the Training Content

This playbook is not just a list of links — it is a guide for building capability in a structured way.  
Use it differently depending on the audience:

- **Internal staff readiness**: Start with Ninja modules before your first customer delivery.  
- **Onboarding customers**: Recommend foundational Ninja modules as preparatory learning.  
- **Delivery support**: Use these as enrichment alongside E2 modules like DLP Advisory or Sensitivity Labelling.  
- **Skill enablement**: Institutions and partners benefit by aligning real training pathways to delivery services.
