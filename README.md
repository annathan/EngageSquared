##  Contribution & Usage Guidelines

- Keep content clear, business-appropriate, and facilitation-friendly.
- Use clients’ terminology where possible — this is not a developer repo.
- No deep technical prescriptive recommendations; guide frameworks, not configurations.
- Maintain all references — reviewers should easily follow public documentation if needed.
