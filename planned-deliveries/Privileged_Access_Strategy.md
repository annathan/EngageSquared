# Privileged Access Strategy

## Status: Coming Soon - Q3 2025
**Expected Duration:** 4-5 weeks  
**Target Audience:** Organizations with complex admin access requirements  
**Prerequisites:** Essential Eight (Maturity Level 2+) or equivalent security foundation

---

## Purpose & Problem Solved

Traditional privileged access models create security risks through permanent administrative rights, shared accounts, and insufficient monitoring. Organizations struggle to balance security requirements with operational efficiency, often resulting in either over-privileged users or complex access request processes that impede business operations.

This engagement implements Zero Trust privileged access using Microsoft's Privileged Identity Management and advanced conditional access policies, creating secure yet efficient administrative access patterns.

---

## Expected Deliverables

- Zero Trust privileged access architecture design
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) deployment and configuration
- Advanced conditional access policies for administrative scenarios
- Just-in-time access workflows aligned to business processes
- Privileged access monitoring and alerting framework
- Emergency access procedures and break-glass protocols
- Administrative role optimization and least-privilege implementation
- Ongoing governance procedures for privileged access lifecycle

## Integration with E2 Portfolio

**Natural Progressions:**
- Essential Eight → Privileged Access Strategy (implements admin privilege controls)
- Security Architecture Review → Privileged Access Strategy (addresses architectural recommendations)
- Privileged Access Strategy → Identity Governance Program (future module)
- Privileged Access Strategy → Advanced Threat Detection (future module)

**Complementary Services:**
- Security Roadmap Workshop (strategic context for access decisions)
- Cloud App Discovery & Controls (privileged access to cloud applications)
- Conditional Access Optimization (future module)

## Key Focus Areas

- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Context-aware access decisions for privileged scenarios
- **Just-in-Time Access:** Temporal administrative rights with business workflow integration
- **Risk-Based Controls:** Adaptive security based on user, device, and context signals
- **Operational Efficiency:** Privileged access that enables rather than hinders operations
- **Monitoring and Compliance:** Comprehensive visibility into administrative activities
- **Emergency Procedures:** Secure break-glass access for crisis scenarios
