# Cloud App Discovery & Controls

## Status: In Development - Q2 2025
**Expected Duration:** 5-6 weeks  
**Target Audience:** Organizations with diverse cloud app portfolios  
**Prerequisites:** Security Roadmap Workshop or equivalent strategic planning

## Purpose & Problem Solved

Shadow IT and unmanaged cloud applications create significant security blind spots and compliance risks. Organizations often discover they have hundreds of cloud applications in use across their environment, many without proper security assessment, governance, or integration with enterprise identity systems.

This engagement provides comprehensive discovery, risk assessment, and governance framework for cloud applications, enabling secure adoption while maintaining appropriate oversight and controls.
