# Essential 8 Delivery

## Introduction & Purpose
The Australian Cyber Security Centre’s **Essential 8 (E8)** is the most practical way for Australian organisations to improve their security maturity. It reduces the risk of common attacks, sets clear priorities, and provides a framework for uplift that is easy to communicate.  

This session will help you understand:  
- Where your organisation stands today against the Essential 8  
- What actions you can take immediately to improve maturity  
- How Microsoft 365 and your existing tools map to E8  
- How E8 aligns with broader frameworks like NIST and Zero Trust  

---

## Rules of Engagement

- **Stay business focused**: Protect the ability to operate, not just tick boxes.  
- **Use plain language**: Keep the discussion accessible for all stakeholders.  
- **Visual first**: Use the E8–M365 mind map during discovery.  
- **Quick wins and future steps**: Identify both short-term and long-term improvements.  
- **No deep dives**: Capture technical questions in a parking lot for follow-up.  
- **Framework agnostic**: E8 can be achieved with Microsoft, AWS, Linux, or other tools. Microsoft is an enabler, not the only path.

3. **Maturity Assessment**  
   - Record current maturity (Level 0–3) for each category  
   - Capture strengths, weaknesses, and quick wins  

4. **Mapping to Microsoft 365**  
   - Show how Microsoft 365 security tools map to each E8 strategy  
   - Call out where existing tools already contribute  

5. **Recommendations & Roadmap**  
   - Prioritised actions by E8 category  
   - Highlight immediate uplift vs. strategic projects

## Closing Facilitator Script
> The Essential 8 is not a checklist you do once and move on.  
> It is a maturity model that adapts as your business, people, and applications evolve.  
> The goal is to keep improving your security posture in a way that makes sense for your business context.  
> Today we identified where you are, what you can do immediately, and how to plan for the next stage of your maturity journey.
