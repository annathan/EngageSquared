## Status: Planned - Q1 2026
**Expected Duration:** 5-7 weeks  
**Target Audience:** Organizations requiring formal incident response capabilities  
**Prerequisites:** Security Roadmap Workshop or equivalent strategic planning

## Purpose & Problem Solved

Many organizations lack structured incident response procedures and disaster recovery plans that integrate security considerations with business continuity requirements. When security incidents occur, response is often ad-hoc, leading to extended downtime, compliance violations, and ineffective remediation.

This engagement develops comprehensive playbooks that integrate security incident response with business continuity planning, ensuring coordinated and effective response to various threat scenarios.
