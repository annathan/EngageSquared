# Purview DLP Advanced

## Status: In Development - Q2 2025
**Expected Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Target Audience:** Organizations with basic DLP seeking comprehensive protection  
**Prerequisites:** Basic DLP Advisory or equivalent DLP experience

---

## Purpose & Problem Solved

This advanced engagement builds on foundational DLP implementation to create sophisticated data protection frameworks. It addresses complex scenarios like custom sensitive information types, endpoint DLP deployment, advanced policy tuning, and integration with broader compliance programs.

Unlike basic DLP advisory, this module focuses on mature policy engineering, custom detection patterns, and enterprise-scale deployment challenges.
