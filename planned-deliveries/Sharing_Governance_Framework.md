## Purpose & Problem Solved

External sharing and guest access in Microsoft 365 creates significant security and compliance challenges. Organizations often struggle with balancing business collaboration needs against data protection requirements, resulting in either overly restrictive policies that hamper productivity or overly permissive settings that create security risks.

This engagement provides a comprehensive framework for secure external collaboration that enables business outcomes while maintaining appropriate controls and governance.
