## Suggested Delivery Flow 

The modules follow an escalation path.  
Start with **Security Foundations**, progress through **Data Security Audit** or **Architecture Review** and **Roadmap**, then branch into more specialised modules.  

- **Security Foundations** → Build a shared understanding (common language and frameworks).  
- **Data Security Audit** or **Security Architecture Review** → Assess where the customer is today.  
- **Security Roadmap Workshop** → Define where the customer wants to go.  
- **Specialised Modules** → Targeted uplifts like Sensitivity Labelling and DLP, with more advanced modules to follow.

## Supporting Resources

| Resource | Purpose | Best Used For |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **[Essential 8 Maturity Score Table](./Essential%208%20Maturity%20Score%20Table.md)** | Provides a standardised template for capturing current vs. target maturity (Level 0–3) for each Essential 8 strategy. Includes space for risks and recommended actions. | Used during workshops or customer sessions to capture results in a structured way. |
| **[Essential 8 in Plain Language](./Essential_Eight_PlainLanguage.md)** | Explains each Essential 8 strategy in simple business language with examples. | Handout or pre-reading for customers and executives who need to understand the "why" without technical jargon. |

##  Contribution & Usage Guidelines

- Keep content clear, business-appropriate, and facilitation-friendly.
- Use clients' terminology where possible — this is not a developer repo.
- No deep technical prescriptive recommendations; guide frameworks, not configurations.
- Maintain all references — reviewers should easily follow public documentation if needed.
