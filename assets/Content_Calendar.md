# Thought Leadership Blueprint: Engage Squared M365 Security Practice

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Right now, we don’t have a single piece of security content in our blog archive. That’s a gap worth fixing.  
Ray Reyes joins the team next week, and between his name in the market and the reach of my LinkedIn series (50K+ impressions across six posts), we already know there’s an audience hungry for practical, plain-English M365 security content.

### The Mission
Position Engage Squared as *the* Microsoft 365 security partner that understands how organisations actually work, not just how tools work.

### The Timeline
Twelve months to build visibility, create demand, and earn speaking opportunities that establish us as a trusted voice in the M365 security space.

### The Plan
A structured 12-month content strategy that Ray and I will lead, using our combined experience to build the E2 security practice brand while staying true to E2’s tone, voice, and values.

---

## Why Now?

E2 has already got the ingredients. We just need a plan that brings it all together.

**The Market Opportunity:**  

My LinkedIn M365 security series hit over 50,000 people. One post alone on automation pulled 17,000 impressions and 1,000+ article views. That’s proof there’s serious interest in clear, practical security guidance.

**Our Current Position:**  

E2’s blog has no security content. We’ve got the skills and customers, but no digital footprint that shows it.


**The Ray Factor:**  

Ray Reyes is well known in this space. His *Mastering Microsoft Defender XDR Deployment* guide gets referenced everywhere. Him joining E2 instantly lifts our credibility.

**Our Differentiator:**  

We get how organisations actually work. That’s what sets us apart from traditional security consultancies.  
E2 brings Information Management, change management, and collaboration expertise to the table. That’s the unfair advantage most of our competitors don’t have.

**The Ask:**  

Ray and I can create the content, but we’ll need support:
- Marketing help for distribution
- Leadership engagement for amplification
- A consistent 12-month cadence  

This is about steady, sustainable visibility.

## Core Positioning

### Tagline

**Microsoft Security that works the way your organisation actually works**

### The Problem We Solve

Most organisations have the right security tools, but not the right approach.  
They’ve got fragmented systems, inconsistent configurations, and a big gap between Microsoft’s vision and day-to-day reality.  
We close that gap by understanding people and processes, not just portals and policies.

### Our Differentiator

We understand how organisations actually work.  
That means:
- We know Information Management and governance inside out  
- We bring real change management experience  
- We understand collaboration and culture, not just compliance  

That’s what makes our advice practical and our results stick.

---

## Content Pillars

Every piece of content connects to one of three themes. These are what we’ll keep coming back to all year.

### 1. The Reality Check

**The uncomfortable truths about M365 security**

This is where we call out what’s really happening in the field, with a bit of humour and honesty.

Examples:
- “You Have E5. So Why Doesn’t Your Security Feel Like It?”
- “The Three Signs Your M365 Security Is More Marketing Than Protection”
- “What Your Secure Score Isn’t Telling You (And Why That Matters)”

---

### 2. The Practical Path

**Tactical, implementable guidance**

This is the “here’s how to actually do it” pillar.  
It matches E2’s friendly, practical voice.

Examples:
- “How to Actually Implement E5 Security (Not Just Turn It On)”
- “The 30-Day Security Baseline That Doesn’t Require a Security Team”
- “Five Defender Configurations That Should Take 10 Minutes (But Usually Take 10 Hours)”

---

### 3. The Business Case

**Making security make sense to non-security people**

This connects security to productivity, collaboration, and real business outcomes.

Examples:
- “How to Explain Your Security Investment to Someone Who Doesn’t Care About Security”
- “Why Your Analysts Are Drowning (And How It’s Costing You Money)”
- “The ROI of M365 Security That Actually Matters to Your CFO”

---

## 12-Month Content Calendar

### Theme

## Distribution and Amplification

We’ll use the LinkedIn multiplier effect.

- Share in Microsoft partner forums and communities
- Cross-promote with partners like AvePoint

### Paid Promotion - Potential
- Use a small paid budget ($500–1000/month) to boost top posts
- Target: IT and Security decision-makers in AU/NZ
- Measure reach, engagement, and leads

### Conferences and Speaking
- Submit sessions to Microsoft Ignite, AISA, and CIO events
- Focus topics: bridging IM and Security, making E5 actually work

---

## Lead Magnet Library

| Q3 | Executive Security Dashboard Template | Power BI file + setup guide |
| Q4 | 2026 M365 Security Planning Workbook | Interactive Excel or PDF planner |

---

## Keeping It Sustainable

**Monthly Workflow**
1. Week 1 – Draft blog (2–3 hours)
2. Week 2 – Internal review and polish
3. Week 3 – Publish + create LinkedIn assets
4. Week 4 – Engage, reply, and measure

**Total time:** 6–7 hours a month split between Ray and me.

**Team Roles**
- Ray and I: content creation  
- Marketing: distribution, visuals, ads  
- Leadership: engagement and amplification  
- Customer Success: inputs for case studies

---

## Style Guidelines

- Start with a relatable scenario  
- Keep it conversational, plain, and human  
- Use short paragraphs and scannable lists  
- Include real stories from the field  
- End with one clear CTA  
- Always sound like people, not a company  

Tone example:  
**Don’t:** “Organisations must implement baseline configurations.”  
**Do:** “If you don’t set baselines, you’ll be playing whack-a-mole forever.”

---

## Visual Identity

- Use clean, simple images that feel protective, not scary  
- Stick with E2 colours and modern design  
- Use carousels for how-to guides, infographics for stats, videos for human stories

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don’t oversell Microsoft-funded workshops  
2. Keep the focus on E2, not individuals  
3. Maintain E2’s tone — friendly and practical  
4. Always connect IM and security  
5. Don’t chase volume over quality

We just need to start telling it.

**What I need:**

- A 12-month commitment to consistency  

The market is ready. The audience is ready.
