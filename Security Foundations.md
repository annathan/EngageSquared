# Security Foundations: The How & Why

## Introduction & Purpose
This session introduces security in a way that goes beyond tools and buzzwords—it’s about *why* security matters and *how* you should think about it strategically. We’ll focus on the **CIA Triad** - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - as a practical, business-aligned foundation.

Many tools promise security, but the real value lies in building systems that:
- Keep data **private and only accessible by the right people** (Confidentiality)
- Ensure data remains **accurate and unaltered** (Integrity)
- Are **available and resilient** when needed, even under stress (Availability)

## Agenda

1. **Rules of Engagement**  
   We’ll start by setting the tone - why this matters, and how we’ll talk about security in your context.

2. **What is the CIA Triad?**  
   A quick, clear breakdown of the three principles and why they matter - anchored in real-world decision-making. We’ll reference core definitions to align the team.

3. **Why It Matters in Practice**  
   Discuss how the triad helps set priorities when tools alone can’t - especially in a world full of default configurations and buzzwords.

4. **Strategic Conversations, Not Tool Audits**  
   We’ll talk business-first: risk appetite, data value, uptime expectations, and real-life tradeoffs - then align tools to those priorities.

5. **Integration with Existing Frameworks**  
   Show how the CIA Triad complements Essential 8, NIST, Zero Trust, without turning this into full compliance mapping.

6. **Next Steps & Call to Action**  
   Frame a simple path: understanding current posture, identifying critical gaps, and building on that foundation.

## Rules of Engagement

- **Stay human, stay strategic**  
  Conversations should help business leaders feel confident - not overwhelmed.

- **No tool worship**  
  It’s easy to believe a tool equals security. We’ll focus on principles and outcomes first.

- **Business-centric questions**  
  Use prompts like:
  - *“What would be the impact if your data were altered by mistake?”* (Integrity)
  - *“If your systems went down for a day, what happens to the business?”* (Availability)
  - *“Who needs access to what—and how do we prevent the wrong people from getting in?”* (Confidentiality)

- **Avoid complexity traps**  
  If the conversation drifts technical too soon, use: *“Great topic—that might be great for a deeper run. Right now, let’s speak to the high-level business goal first.”*

- **Frame tool talk within context**  
  If tools are mentioned, tie them back:  
  *“Yes, this tool can encrypt files—but how do we decide *which* files actually need that level of protection?”*

## What is the CIA Triad?

| Principle         | Definition                                                                           | Why It Matters in Business Context                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users/processes can access or view data. | Prevents leaks of sensitive or proprietary information—protects trust, reputation, and compliance. |
| **Integrity**       | Ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered. | Prevents damage from accidental or malicious changes—ensures reliable decision-making.           |
| **Availability**    | Ensures authorized users can access necessary data and services when needed. | Keeps operations running smoothly—reduces downtime, supports customer trust and business continuity. |

## Why the CIA Triad Still Matters

- **It provides clarity** in a crowded tool landscape—making the security conversation tactical and tangible rather than theoretical. 
- **Highlights tensions**—for example, strict access (confidentiality) may reduce availability; bandwidth for backups (availability) may impact performance. It helps frame trade-offs. 
- **Anchors meaningful decisions** - we prioritize what matters to business continuity, not just feature toggles.

## From Concepts to Action

1. **Map your environment** to the triad:
   - _What data needs strong confidentiality controls (e.g. encryption, MFA)?_
   - _Where integrity is critical (e.g. transactional systems, audit logs)?_
   - _Where availability must be high (e.g. customer-facing portals, supply chain tools)?_

2. **Prioritize strategic improvements**:
   - Quick wins (e.g. enable MFA or backups)
   - Longer-term investments (e.g. data integrity monitoring, redundant architecture)

3. **Tie back to frameworks**:
   - Use **Essential 8** to anchor actions today
   - Show how **NIST CSF** and **Zero Trust** can layer on your CIA-based posture

## Closing Thought

Security is less about ticking boxes than it is about *making systems trustworthy*. The CIA Triad is your compass—helping us ask the right questions, prioritize what matters to your business, and build resilience, not just configurations.
