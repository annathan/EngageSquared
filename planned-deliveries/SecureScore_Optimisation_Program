## Purpose & Problem Solved

Microsoft Secure Score provides valuable security recommendations, but many organizations struggle to prioritize improvements effectively or align security investments with business outcomes. Generic score improvement often leads to implementing controls that don't address actual business risks or operational context.

This program provides systematic, business-aligned approach to Secure Score improvement that maximizes security ROI while building measurable maturity improvements.
